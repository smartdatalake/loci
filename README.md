## LOCI

#### Overview

LOCI is a Python library providing high-level functions for exploring, mining and visualizing Points and Areas of Interest. It is under ongoing development. It currently supports the following functionalities:

- Create a GeoDataFrame from POI data in a CSV file.
- Display POIs on the map.
- Filter POIs by category or keywords.
- Compute and visualize statistics about POI categories or keywords.
- Generate word clouds from POI categories or keywords.
- Generate heatmaps from POI locations.
- Construct and visualize a grid structure over POI locations.
- Compute and visualize POI clusters using density-based clustering.
- Use LDA to extract and assign topics to clusters.
- Use of frequent itemset mining to discover frequent location sets.

LOCI was originally developed in the EU H2020 project [SLIPO](http://slipo.eu/). In SmartDataLake, its functionality is being extended to include:

- Detection of Areas of Interest characterized by high or low mixture of POI types.
- Analytics over time series data.
